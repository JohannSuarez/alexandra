{
  "id": "234324234",
  "aliases": [
    "alias_a",
    "alias_b"
  ],
  "log": {
    "2020": {
      "july": {
        "1": {
          "channel1": "63",
          "channel2": "43"
        },
        "2": {
          "channel3": "20"
        }
      },
      "august": {
        "29": {
          "some_voice_channel": "80",
          "some_voice_channel2": "80"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

  Read file, put all IDs in a Python Set (Sets don't allow duplicates)
